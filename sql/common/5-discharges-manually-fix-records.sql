-- In this file we will add any UPDATE statements that are used to manually edit entries in the `derived.admissions` table
-- Note that modifying this table is safe, because it is easy to regenerate it from the raw `public.session` table (which we should never modify)

-- You would add statements like
-- UPDATE derived.discharges
-- SET...
-- WHERE
-- ...

select 1; -- dummy query so running this doens't break sql-runner
